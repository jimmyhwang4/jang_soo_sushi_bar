                        <p>We are fully aware of the impact of COVID-19 in our community, and during these challenging times, we are prioritizing the health and safety of you and our family of employees. Currently, we are following the guidance and recommendations from the City of Hawaiian Gardens and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We have implemented necessary changes in order to maintain the highest possible standards in service and quality.</p>
                        <p><br></br></p>
                        <p>These changes include:</p>
                        <p>• Only providing outdoor dining and take-outs while strictly limiting physical interaction between customers and staff.</p>
                        <p>• Increasing the frequency of cleaning practices and decontamination procedures within our restaurant.</p>
                        <p>• Increased presence and use of hand sanitizers and soap.</p>
                        <p>• Ensuring that our staff is wearing masks and educating them on preventative measures and new updates.</p>
                        <p><br></br></p>
                        <p>Regarding the dine-in experience in our restaurant, we are currently only organizing reservations for outdoor dining until a full reopening is decided. We require every customer to have a mask on, and we will be actively checking for body temperatures that indicate a fever upon entrance. Please call (562) 924-2498 to make a reservation for outdoor dining.</p>
                        <p>As for the possibility of a full reopening, we are actively monitoring current events and still gauging the appropriate time for this. An update will be posted in the near future.</p>
